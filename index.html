      <h2>It pays to park smarter!</h2>
      <p>Illegal and inconsiderate parking is more than an inconvenience, it can be dangerous for pedestrians and other road users!</p>
      <p><strong>To avoid receiving a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN), follow the applicable parking signs.</strong></p>

      <h2>Penalty Charge Notice</h2>
      <p><strong>Please pay your penalty charge on time to avoid further expense.</strong></p>
      <h3>Option 1: Pay</h3>
      <p>To start the process to pay your Penalty Charge Notice (PCN), please enter your PCN number:</p>
      <form class="pcn-field">
        <label></label>
        <textarea></textarea>
      </form>
      <a class="cta-click" href="https://www.paynotice.co.uk/Derbyshire/Pages/Step1.aspx?LoadRefNo=test">Submit</a>
      <h3>Option 2: Dispute your PCN</h3>
      <p>If you believe your Parking Charge Notice (PCN) was issued incorrectly, you have the right to dispute it. Submitting an appeal allows you to explain what happened and request that the charge be reviewed.</p>
      <p>You can provide supporting evidence such as photos, receipts, witness statements, or any details that help clarify the circumstances.</p>
      <p>Once submitted, your case will be assessed in line with our policies and industry guidelines, and you'll receive a written decision.</p>
      <p>Disputing your PCN is free, and you will not incur additional charges while your appeal is being considered.</p>

      <h2>Ignore the signs, pay the fines</h2>
      <p><strong>Derbyshire County Council have taken over responsibility for enforcing parking restrictions on the streets of Derbyshire (excluding Derby city).</strong></p>
      <p>Traditional traffic wardens have been replaced by <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/our-officers.html">Civil Enforcement Officers (CEOs)</a>.</p>
      <p>This is known as Civil Parking Enforcement (CPE) and Park Smarter is the civil parking enforcement partnership that will enforce off-street and on-street car parking in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Parking enforcement will:</p>
      <ul class="bodylist">
        <li>improve safety for everyone using the roads and pavements</li>
        <li>keep roads free from obstruction and keep the traffic moving</li>
        <li>prevent abuse of blue badge spaces for people with disabilities</li>
        <li>help make short stay spaces in town centre car parks more available for shoppers</li>
        <li>make sure emergency services vehicles and buses can get to where they need to go</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rules on parking haven't changed - only who will be issuing Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs). New teams of civil enforcement officers will be out and about across Derbyshire and they will issue PCNs to motorists who don't stick to the parking rules.</p>
      <p>If you pay the PCN within 14 days the charge will be £35 for a serious offence or £25 for a minor offence. These rise to either £70 or £50 after 14 days.</p>
      <p>On this website you can pay any PCNs you receive, find out how to challenge or appeal your PCN, and access our polices on enforcement and parking.</p>
      <p>Park Smarter is a partnership between Derbyshire County Council and the 8 district and borough councils:</p>
      <ul class="bodylist">
        <li>Amber Valley Borough Council</li>
        <li>Bolsover District Council</li>
        <li>Chesterfield Borough Council</li>
        <li>Derbyshire Dales District Council</li>
        <li>Erewash Borough Council</li>
        <li>High Peak Borough Council</li>
        <li>North East Derbyshire District Council</li>
        <li>South Derbyshire District Council</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It does not include Derby City Council.</p>
      <p>The councils are members of the Parking and Traffic Regulations Outside London (PATROL) Adjudication Joint Committee.</p>
      <p>The joint committee publishes an Annual Statement of Accounts which is subject to external audit and the arrangements for 2010/2011 can be found at <a href="https://www.patrol.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=34&pageID=69">Patrol UK</a>.</p>
